Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n",

However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.\n",

Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.\n",
