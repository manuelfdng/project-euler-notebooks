<p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).</p>

<p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key.

<p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both ""halves"", it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>

<p>A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.</p>
<p>In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.</p>
<ul><li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):

<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>
<li>Go to next R</li>
<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>
<li>Go back 3 squares.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><p>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between ""Just Visiting"" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to ""get out of jail"", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.</p>
<p>By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.</p>
<p>Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.</p>

<p>For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:</p>
<p class=""margin_left monospace"">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br />
VIIIIIIIIIII<br />
VVIIIIII<br />
XIIIIII<br />
VVVI<br />
XVI</p>
<p>However, according to the rules only <span class=""monospace"">XIIIIII</span> and <span class=""monospace"">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.</p>
<p>The 11K text file, <a href=""project/resources/p089_roman.txt"">roman.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see <a href=""about=roman_numerals"">About... Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem.</p>
<p>Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.</p>
<p class=""smaller"">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>

89,"<p>Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.</p>

<p>For example, the square number 64 could be formed:</p>

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p090.png"" class=""dark_img"" alt="""" /><br /></div>

<p>In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.</p>

<p>For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.</p>

<p>However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.</p>

<p>In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.</p>

<p class=""margin_left"">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}<br />
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}</p>

<p>But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.</p>

<p>How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?</p>

90,"<p>The points P (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>) and Q (<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.</p>

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p091_1.png"" class=""dark_img"" alt="""" /><br /></div>

<p>There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,<br />0 ≤ <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub> ≤ 2.</p>

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p091_2.png"" alt="""" /><br /></div>

<p>Given that 0 ≤ <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub> ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?</p>

91,"
<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class=""margin_left"">44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <b>1</b> → <b>1</b><br />
85 → <b>89</b> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <b>89</b></p>
<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>

"
92,"<p>By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class=""monospace margin_left"">8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2<br />
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)<br />
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1<br />
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)</p>
<p>Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.</p>
<p>Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.</p>
<p>Find the set of four distinct digits, <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>c</i> &lt; <i>d</i>, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to <i>n</i>, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.</p>

"
93,"<p>It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.</p>
<p>We shall define an <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the perimeters of all <i>almost equilateral triangles</i> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).</p>

"
94,"<p>The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.</p>
<p>Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:</p>
<p class=""center"">12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)</p>
<p>Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.</p>
<p>Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.</p>

95,"<p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.</p>

<p>A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ ""guess and test"" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.</p>

100,"<p>If we are presented with the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>
<p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, <br /><var>u</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> = <var>n</var><sup>3</sup>: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...</p>
<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that ""simple is best"" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>
<p>We shall define OP(<var>k</var>, <var>n</var>) to be the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first <var>k</var> terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(<var>k</var>, <var>n</var>) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for <var>n</var> ≤ <var>k</var>, and potentially the <i>first incorrect term</i> (FIT) will be OP(<var>k</var>, <var>k</var>+1); in which case we shall call it a <i>bad OP</i> (BOP).</p>
<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for <var>n</var> ≥ 2, OP(1, <var>n</var>) = <var>u</var><sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:</p>
<div class=""margin_left"">
<table><tr><td>OP(1, <var>n</var>) = 1</td>
<td>1, <span class=""red""><b>1</b></span>, 1, 1, ...</td>

<td>1, 8, <span class=""red""><b>15</b></span>, ...</td>
</tr><tr><td>OP(3, <var>n</var>) = 6<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>−11<var>n</var>+6     </td>

</tr><tr><td>OP(4, <var>n</var>) = <var>n</var><sup>3</sup></td>
<td>1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...</td>
</tr></table></div>
<p>Clearly no BOPs exist for <var>k</var> ≥ 4.</p>

<p>The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>
<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>
<p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a ""doubles out"" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is ""bust"".</p>

110,"<p>Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:</p>
<p class=""center"">1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111</p>
<p>We shall say that M(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an <i>n</i>-digit prime where <i>d</i> is the repeated digit, N(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the number of such primes, and S(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the sum of these primes.</p>
<p>So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for <i>d</i> = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.</p>

152,"<p>As we all know the equation <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>=-1 has no solutions for real <var>x</var>.
<br />
If we however introduce the imaginary number <var>i</var> this equation has two solutions: <var>x=i</var> and <var>x=-i</var>.
<br />
If we go a step further the equation (<var>x</var>-3)<sup>2</sup>=-4 has two complex solutions: <var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var>.
<br /><var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var> are called each others' complex conjugate.
<br />
Numbers of the form <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> are called complex numbers.
<br />
In general <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> and <var>a</var>−<var>bi</var> are each other's complex conjugate.</p>
<p>A Gaussian Integer is a complex number <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> such that both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are integers.
<br />
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with <var>b</var>=0).
<br />
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with <var>b</var> ≠ 0 we call such integers ""rational integers.""
<br />
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var> if the result is also a Gaussian integer.
<br />
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2<var>i</var> we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
<br />
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2<var>i</var>: 1−2<var>i</var>.
<br />
The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
<br />
So 1+2<var>i</var> is a divisor of 5.
<br />
Note that 1+<var>i</var> is not a divisor of 5 because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.
<br />
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (<var>a</var>+<var>bi</var>) is a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var>, then its complex conjugate (<var>a</var>−<var>bi</var>) is also a divisor of <var>n</var>.</p>
<p>In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2<var>i</var>, 1 − 2<var>i</var>, 2 + <var>i</var>, 2 − <var>i</var>, 5}.
<br />
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:</p>

181,"<p>The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:</p>
<p>Generate two distinct primes <var>p</var> and <var>q</var>.<br />Compute <var>n=pq</var> and φ=(<var>p</var>-1)(<var>q</var>-1).<br />
Find an integer <var>e</var>, 1&lt;<var>e</var>&lt;φ, such that gcd(<var>e</var>,φ)=1.</p>
<p>A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,<var>n</var>-1].<br />
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval [0,<var>n</var>-1]).<br />
To encrypt the text,  for each message, <var>m</var>, <var>c</var>=<var>m</var><sup><var>e</var></sup> mod <var>n</var> is calculated.</p>
<p>To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate <var>d</var> such that <var>ed</var>=1 mod φ, then for each encrypted message, <var>c</var>, calculate <var>m=c<sup>d</sup></var> mod <var>n</var>.</p>
<p>There exist values of <var>e</var> and <var>m</var>  such that <var>m<sup>e</sup></var> mod <var>n=m</var>.<br />We call messages <var>m</var> for which <var>m<sup>e</sup></var> mod <var>n=m</var> unconcealed messages.</p>
<p>An issue when choosing <var>e</var> is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.  <br />For instance, let <var>p</var>=19 and <var>q</var>=37.<br />
Then <var>n</var>=19*37=703 and φ=18*36=648.<br />
If we choose <var>e</var>=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all possible messages<br /><var>m</var> (0≤<var>m</var>≤<var>n</var>-1) are unconcealed when calculating <var>m<sup>e</sup></var> mod <var>n</var>.<br />
For any valid choice of <var>e</var> there exist some unconcealed messages.<br />
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.</p>
<p>Choose <var>p</var>=1009 and <var>q</var>=3643.<br />
Find the sum of all values of <var>e</var>, 1&lt;<var>e</var>&lt;φ(1009,3643) and gcd(<var>e</var>,φ)=1, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of <var>e</var> is at a minimum.</p>

Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not containing any of the given points in its interior (in addition to the vertices, other given points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon). 
</p>
<p>
As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few such convex holes. 
The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to 1049694.5 square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex hole on the given set of points.

252,"<p>A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.</p>

<p>Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.<br /> As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together.<br /> The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).</p><p>

</p><p>For example:</p>
<div class=""center"">

<p>Let <var>M</var> be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.<br />
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each <var>M</var> is</p>

254,"<p>We define the <i>rounded-square-root</i> of a positive integer <var>n</var> as the square root of <var>n</var> rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var>:</p>
<p>Let <var>d</var> be the number of digits of the number <var>n</var>.<br />
If <var>d</var> is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.<br />
If <var>d</var> is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.<br />
Repeat:</p>
$$x_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x_k + \lceil{n / x_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

<p>until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.</p>
<p>As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var> = 4321.<br /><var>n</var> has 4 digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.<br />
$$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 / 70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$
$$x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 / 66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.<br />
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).
</p>
<p>The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.<br />
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

<p>Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (10<sup>13</sup> ≤ <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>14</sup>)?<br />
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

</span><p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>

<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>·<var>b</var>.<br />
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br />
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>
<div align=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p256_tatami3.gif"" alt=""p256_tatami3.gif"" /><br /></div>

<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red ""<span style=""color:#FF0000;""><b>X</b></span>"" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>

<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br />
Further, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.</p>

<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7×10.<br />
All the other rooms of size <var>s</var> = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.<br />
Hence, <var>T</var>(70) = 1.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:<br />
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.<br />
In fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.</p>

$a_{n+1} = \frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, ""d"".

The sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.

<p>It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if <var>a</var>=<var>c</var>.</p>

<p>So, given that <var>a</var>=<var>c</var>, we are looking for triplets (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>) such that at least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.</p>

<p>For example, if (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. 
Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.</p>

299,"<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. <br />
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> distinct proteins consisting of <var>n</var> elements.</p>

<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.<br />
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.<br />
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in <u>two dimensions</u>.</p>

On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p>

<li>On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.</li>
<li>The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.</li>
</ul><p>If $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, $X(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ that returns:</p>

<ul><li>zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or</li>
<li>non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.</li>
</ul><p>For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:</p>

<ul><li>current player moves to $(1,2,1)$</li>

The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.
</p>
<p>
The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick"">Duchy of Grand Fenwick</a>, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
</p>
<p>
You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.<br />
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to π*250<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter will be π*500 m, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.
</p>
<p>
However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and 75√2 m the total area becomes 238750 m<sup>2</sup> and the perimeter becomes 1400+300√2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.

To turn on a ""<b>2</b>"" will cost 5 transitions, while a ""<b>7</b>"" will cost only 4 transitions.</p>

<p>Sam and Max built two different clocks.</p>

<p>Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows ""<b>137</b>"", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (""<b>11</b>"") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (""<b>2</b>"") is turned on and, after some time, off.<br />
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:<br /></p><table><tr><td>""<b>137</b>""</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions (""<b>137</b>"" on/off).</td>
</tr><tr><td>""<b>11</b>""</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions (""<b>11</b>"" on/off).</td>
</tr><tr><td>""<b>2</b>""</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(5) × 2 = 10 transitions (""<b>2</b>"" on/off).</td>
</tr></table>
For a grand total of 40 transitions.

<p>Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.<br />
For number 137, Max's clock requires:<br /></p><table><tr><td>""<b>137</b>""<br /><br /></td>
<td>:<br /><br /></td>
<td>2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (""<b>137</b>"" on)<br />
7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number ""<b>11</b>"").</td>
</tr><tr><td>""<b>11</b>""<br /><br /><br /></td>
<td>:<br /><br /><br /></td>
<td>0 transitions (number ""<b>11</b>"" is already turned on correctly)<br />
3 transitions (to turn off the first ""<b>1</b>"" and the bottom part of the second ""<b>1</b>""; <br />
the top part is common with number ""<b>2</b>"").</td>
</tr><tr><td>""<b>2</b>""<br /><br /></td>
<td>:<br /><br /></td>
<td>4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a ""<b>2</b>"")<br />
5 transitions (to turn off number ""<b>2</b>"").</td>
</tr></table>
For a grand total of 30 transitions.

<p>Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.<br />
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2×10<sup>7</sup>. <br />
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.</p>

<p>If <var>n</var>=8, we might decide to use a ""binary search"" type of strategy: Our first question would be ""<b>4</b>"" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.<br />
Let our second question be ""<b>6</b>"". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.<br />
Thus, our third question will be ""<b>7</b>"" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=<span style=""color:#FF0000;""><b>17</b></span>.</p>

<p>We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for <var>n</var>=8, by asking ""<b>5</b>"" as our first question.<br />
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be ""<b>7</b>"", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=<span style=""color:#3333FF;""><b>12</b></span>).<br />
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be ""<b>3</b>"" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be ""<b>1</b>"", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=<span style=""color:#3333FF;""><b>9</b></span>.<br />
Since <span style=""color:#3333FF;""><b>12</b></span>&gt;<span style=""color:#3333FF;""><b>9</b></span>, the worst-case cost for this strategy is <span style=""color:#FF0000;""><b>12</b></span>.

<br />For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6.

333,"<p>In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.<br />
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.<br />
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.<br /> The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.</p>

<p>For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:</p>

335,"<p>A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. <br />
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.<br />
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.</p>

<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.</p>

Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.
</p>

<p>
Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:<br /><br />
The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. 
For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
</p><ul><li>If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.</li>
<li>If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).</li>
</ul><p>
Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
</p><ul><li>Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98<sup>5</sup> = 0.9039207968.</li>
<li>Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.</li>
</ul><p>
Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5 = 1.480396016.<br />
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 × 5 = <b>7.40198008</b> tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !
</p>

<p>
Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:
</p><ul><li>We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.</li>
<li>If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).</li>
<li>We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.</li>
</ul><p>
To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.
</p>
For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the <i>optimal strategy</i>) requires an average of just <b>4.155452</b> tests!


<p>
Using the optimal strategy, let T(<var>s</var>,<var>p</var>) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of <var>s</var> sheep for a virus having probability <var>p</var> to be present in any individual.<br />

A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$ and radius $r$. 
</p>

<p>
There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$ with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North Pole station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.
</p>

<p>
All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky. If <var>d</var> is the length of the road between two stations, $\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used roads.
</p>

<p>
A direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the length $\pi r$ and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station via $(0,r,0)$ has the same length, but a smaller risk:</p>
\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2=0.5

The <b>Pythagorean tree</b> is a fractal generated by the following procedure:
</p>

<p>
Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the animation, the bottom side is the base):
</p><ol><li> Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).</li>
<li> Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its sides coinciding with that leg.</li>
<li> Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering as their bases the sides touching the triangle.</li>
</ol>
The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the Pythagorean tree.

6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.<br />
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.<br /> 
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.<br />
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:<br />
8730-0378=8352<br />
8532-2358=6174
</p>
<p>
6174 is called the <b>Kaprekar constant</b>. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the <b>Kaprekar routine</b>.
</p>
<p>
We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.<br /> 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.<br />
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3≠9, a Kaprekar constant exists.<br />
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)<sub>15</sub><br />
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)<sub>21</sub></p>
<p>
Define <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> to be the Kaprekar constant in base <var>b</var> for 5 digits.
Define the function <var>sb(i)</var> to be
</p><ul><li> 0 if i = <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> or if <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> consists of 5 identical digits
</li><li> the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base <var>b</var> to arrive at <var>C<sub>b</sub></var>, otherwise
</li></ul>
Note that we can define <var>sb(i)</var> for all integers <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>. If <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.

<p>
Define <var>S(b)</var> as the sum of <var>sb(i)</var> for 0 &lt; <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>.<br />
E.g. S(15) = 5274369<br />

<p>On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes through the other two.</p>

<p>The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.<br />
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.<br />
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.<br />
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.<br />
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case ""h"" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case ""v"". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the ""tens"" and the second one for the ""units"". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.</p>

<p>The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.</p>

430,"<p>Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.</p>

<p>Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m<sup>3</sup>. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.</p>

<div class=""center"">
   <img src=""project/images/p431_grain_silo.png"" class=""dark_img"" alt=""p431_grain_silo.png"" /></div>

<p>We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.</p>

<p>Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.</p>

<p>If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.</p>

433,"<p>Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.<br />
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.<br />
A <strong>flexible</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.<br />
A <strong>rigid</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.<br />
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.
</p>
<p>The <strong>grid graphs</strong> embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:</p>
<div class=""center""><img src=""project/images/p434_rigid.gif"" class=""dark_img"" alt=""p434_rigid.gif"" /></div>
<p>However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:</p>
<div class=""center""><img src=""project/images/p434_rigid23.png"" class=""dark_img"" alt=""p434_rigid23.png"" /></div>

When we calculate 8<sup>n</sup> modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7.<br />
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a <b>primitive root</b> of 11.<br />
But there is more:<br />
If we take a closer look we see:<br />
1+8=9<br />
8+9=17≡6 mod 11<br />
9+6=15≡4 mod 11<br />

3+2=5<br />
2+5=7<br />

So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8<sup>n</sup> + 8<sup>n+1</sup> ≡ 8<sup>n+2</sup> (mod 11).<br />

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(<var>d</var>, 1) for an integer <var>d</var>.
</p>
<p>
In each step, the ant at point (<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>0</sub>) chooses one of the lattice points (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) which satisfy <var>x</var><sub>1</sub> ≥ 0 and <var>y</var><sub>1</sub> ≥ 1 and goes straight to (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) at a constant velocity <var>v</var>. The value of <var>v</var> depends on <var>y</var><sub>0</sub> and <var>y</var><sub>1</sub> as follows:
</p><ul><li> If <var>y</var><sub>0</sub> = <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>, the value of <var>v</var> equals <var>y</var><sub>0</sub>.</li>
<li> If <var>y</var><sub>0</sub> ≠ <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>, the value of <var>v</var> equals (<var>y</var><sub>1</sub> - <var>y</var><sub>0</sub>) / (ln(<var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) - ln(<var>y</var><sub>0</sub>)).</li>
</ul><p>
The left image is one of the possible paths for <var>d</var> = 4. First the ant goes from A(0, 1) to P<sub>1</sub>(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) ≈ 1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.<br />
From P<sub>1</sub>(1, 3) to P<sub>2</sub>(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P<sub>2</sub>(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.<br />
Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.
</p>
<p>
The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for <var>d</var> = 4.

<p>Let <var>t</var> represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If <var>t</var> = 0, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn <var>i</var>, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if <var>i</var> &lt; <var>t</var> the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If <var>i</var> = <var>t</var>, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, <var>t</var> is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost <var>ct</var> for some constant <var>c</var>. For <var>c</var> = 0, <var>t</var> can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(<var>d</var>, <var>c</var>) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair <var>d</var>-sided die and cost constant <var>c</var>. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.</p>

<p>Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:</p>

<p>In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.</p>

<p>Let S(<var>d</var>, <var>c</var>) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair <var>d</var>-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant <var>c</var>. For example, S(6, 1) = 208.3.</p>

Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$<br />
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is used at most once in this sum.<br />
Even then this representation is not unique.<br />
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents are used and that the representation is finite.<br />
E.g: 
$2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$
</p>
<p>
To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.<br />
We call this the representation in the <b>phigital numberbase</b>.<br />
So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$. <br />

477,"<p>Let us consider <b>mixtures</b> of three substances: <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> in it, i.e., (<var>a</var> : <var>b</var> : <var>c</var>). For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2 : 3 : 5) contains 20% <b>A</b>, 30% <b>B</b> and 50% <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.</p>

<p>For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3 : 0 : 2), (3 : 6 : 11) and (3 : 3 : 4). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6 : 5 : 9), since:<br />
(10·<sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> + 20·<sup>3</sup>/<sub>20</sub> + 30·<sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> : 10·<sup>0</sup>/<sub>5</sub> + 20·<sup>6</sup>/<sub>20</sub> + 30·<sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> : 10·<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub> + 20·<sup>11</sup>/<sub>20</sub> + 30·<sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub>)
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)</p>

<p>However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3 : 2 : 1), since the amount of <b>B</b> is always less than the amount of <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>Let <var>n</var> be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>) with 0 ≤ <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> ≤ <var>n</var> and gcd(<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio (<var>a</var> : <var>b</var> : <var>c</var>). Let M(<var>n</var>) be the set of all such mixtures.</p>

<p>For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:<br />
{(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2), (0 : 2 : 1), <br />
(1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0), (1 : 1 : 1), <br />

Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.<br />
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.<br />
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a <dfn title=""a proper divisor of n is a divisor of n smaller than n"">proper divisor</dfn> of the number of stones present in the pile.<br /> E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.<br />
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.<br />

521,"<p>Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.</p> 

<p>To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.</p>

<p>For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:</p>

<p align=""center""><img src=""project/images/p522_hilberts_blackout.png"" alt=""p522_hilberts_blackout.png"" /></p>

<p>If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can <i>receive</i> power from many other floors at once, it can only <i>send</i> power to one other floor.</p>

<p>To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.</p>

<p>Let F(<var>n</var>) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of <var>n</var> floors. For example, F(3) = 6, F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.</p>

526,"<p>A secret integer <var>t</var> is selected at random within the range 1 ≤ <var>t</var> ≤ <var>n</var>. </p>

<p>The goal is to guess the value of <var>t</var> by making repeated guesses, via integer <var>g</var>. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either <var>g</var> &lt; <var>t</var>, <var>g</var> = <var>t</var>, or <var>g</var> &gt; <var>t</var>. Then the process can repeat as necessary.</p>

<p>Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound <var>L</var> and upper bound <var>H</var> (initialized to <var>L</var> = 1 and <var>H</var> = <var>n</var>), let <var>g</var> = ⌊(<var>L</var>+<var>H</var>)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer floor function. If <var>g</var> = <var>t</var>, the process ends. Otherwise, if <var>g</var> &lt; <var>t</var>, set <var>L</var> = <var>g</var>+1, but if <var>g</var> &gt; <var>t</var> instead, set <var>H</var> = <var>g</var>−1. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once <var>t</var> is found. Even if <var>t</var> can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.</p>

<p>Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting <var>g</var> = ⌊(<var>L</var>+<var>H</var>)/2⌋, simply let <var>g</var> be a random integer between <var>L</var> and <var>H</var>, inclusive.

<p>His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.</p>

<p>Now Bob places <var>n</var> bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle.

For example, a weak queen on a <var>n</var>×<var>n</var> board with a weakness factor of <var>w</var>=1 located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move <var>n</var>−1 squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move <var>n</var>−2 squares in these directions.

Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which <var>b</var> = 0.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer <b>unit</b> is one for which <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = 1, i.e. one of 1, i, -1, -i.<br />
Let's define a <i>proper</i> Gaussian integer as one for which <var>a</var> &gt; 0 and <var>b</var> ≥ 0.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer z<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>1</sub>i is said to be divisible by <var>z</var><sub>2</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>2</sub>i if <var>z</var><sub>3</sub> = <var>a</var><sub>3</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>3</sub>i = <var>z</var><sub>1</sub>/<var>z</var><sub>2</sub> is a Gaussian integer.<br />
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$<br />
So, <var>z</var><sub>1</sub> is divisible by <var>z</var><sub>2</sub> if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.<br />
For example, 2 is divisible by 1 + i because 2/(1 + i) = 1 - i is a Gaussian integer.</p>

<p>A <b>Gaussian prime</b> is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.<br />
For example, 1 + 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by 1, i, -1, -i, 1 + 2i, i(1 + 2i) = i - 2, -(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i and -i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i.<br />
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1 + i.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.<br />
For example 2 = -i(1 + i)<sup>2</sup> and 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i).<br />
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.<br />
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1 + 3i is.<br />
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.</p>

<p>Let <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> ≤ n.<br />

562,"<p>A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.</p>

<p>For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip.  The next could take 10 of these 11×1 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110×1 strip, or a 11×10 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.</p>

<p>One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950.  The target area of 889200 is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.</p>

<p>Let M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in <u>exactly</u> n variants with the longer edge not greater than 10% bigger than the shorter edge.  Hence M(3) = 889200.</p>

For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which is composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line segment with length $2$.

574,"<p>It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.</p>

<p>She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.</p>

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png"" alt=""p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png"" /></div>

<p>Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.</p>

<p>Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.</p>

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png"" alt=""p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png"" /><br /><div style=""font-style:italic;"">(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits</div>

</div>

<p>The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.</p>

<p>Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].</p>

<p>In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.<br />

583,"<p>A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called ""<b>Birthday Problem</b>"". The description of the problem was as follows:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other</b>.</i></p>

<p>The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.</p>


<p>After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other</b>.</i></p>

<p>With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.</p>


<p>This time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the problem description had changed. It read:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other</b>.</i></p>

Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.
</p>
<p>
On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.
</p>
<p>
The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be $E(m,n)$. Hence $E(60,30)=1036.15...$

596,"The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:

<ul><li>
A division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.
</li><li>
All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.

The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.
</li><li>
Each boat continues rowing until <em>either</em> it reaches the finish line <em>or</em> it catches up with (""bumps"") a boat in front.
</li><li>
The finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)
</li><li>
When a ""bump"" occurs, the ""bumping"" boat takes no further part in the race. The ""bumped"" boat must continue, however, and may even be ""bumped"" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.
</li><li>
After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$ that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:

(In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)

<p>
Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.
</p>
<p>
Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an <b>even permutation</b> of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.
</p>
<p>
For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:
</p>
<table cellspacing=""15"" align=""center""><tr><th> Bumps occurring </th>
  <th> New order </th>
  <th> Permutation </th>
  <th> Probability </th>
 </tr><tr align=""center""><td> none </td>
  <td> $A$, $B$, $C$ </td>
  <td> even </td>
  <td> $4/15$ </td>
 </tr><tr align=""center""><td> $B$ bumps $C$ </td>
  <td> $A$, $C$, $B$ </td>

  <td> $B$, $A$, $C$ </td>
  <td> odd </td>
  <td> $1/3$ </td>

  <td> $C$, $B$, $A$ </td>

The well-known <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong> puzzle has many fascinating mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube in a non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have $n$ different colours available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.
</p>
<p>
We say that two such colourings $c_1,c_2$ are <em>essentially distinct</em> if a cube coloured according to $c_1$ cannot be made to match a cube coloured according to $c_2$ by performing mechanically possible Rubik's Cube moves.
</p>
<p>
For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially distinct colourings.

For every positive number $n$ we define the function  $streak(n)=k$   as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.<br />
E.g:<br />
13 is divisible by 1 <br />
14 is divisible by 2 <br />
15 is divisible by 3 <br />
16 is divisible by 4 <br />
17 is NOT divisible by 5 <br />

Similarly:<br />
120 is divisible by 1 <br />
121 is NOT divisible by 2 <br />

Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.
</p>
<p>
As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes <b>THHH—TTTT—THHT—H</b> beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\times 2\times 1 = 4$.
</p>
<p>
Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.

Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:

The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.

We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.</p>

<p>Note that ""perfectly meshing"" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for $S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.</p>

<p>Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions. For example, $g(16,5,5,6)=9$.</p>

A riffle shuffle is executed as follows: a deck of cards is split into two equal halves, with the top half taken in the left hand and the bottom half taken in the right hand. Next, the cards are interleaved exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the location of the top and bottom card of the deck)
</p>
<p>
Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed to restore a deck of size $n$ to its original configuration, where $n$ is a positive even number.</p>
<p>
Amazingly, a standard deck of $52$ cards will first return to its original configuration after only $8$ perfect shuffles, so $s(52) = 8$. It can be verified that a deck of $86$ cards will also return to its original configuration after exactly $8$ shuffles, and the sum of all values of $n$ that satisfy $s(n) = 8$ is $412$.

"
622,"<p>The <i>lambda-calculus</i> is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on <i>lambda-terms</i>, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:</p>
<ul><li>Any <i>variable</i> $x$ (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.</li>
<li>If $M$ and $N$ are lambda-terms, then $(M N)$ is a lambda-term, called the <i>application</i> of $M$ to $N$.</li>
<li>If $x$ is a variable and $M$ is a term, then $(\lambda x. M)$ is a lambda-term, called an <i>abstraction</i>. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking $x$ as parameter and sending back $M$.</li>
</ul><p>A lambda-term $T$ is said to be <i>closed</i> if for all variables $x$, all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some abstraction $(\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction is said to <i>bind</i> the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term $(\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\lambda x. (x y))$ is not because $y$ is not bound.</p>

<p>Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that $(\lambda x. x)$ and $(\lambda y. y)$ should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called <i>$\alpha$-equivalent</i>. Note that $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda x. (\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\alpha$-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda y. (\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\alpha$-equivalent.</p>

<p>The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\lambda$, dot and variables.</p>

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}

643,"<p>Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length $L$ by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. </p>

<p>As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either ""straight"" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or ""diagonal"" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.<br />
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.</p>
<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p644_squareline.png"" alt=""p644_squareline.png"" /></div>
<p>
With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. </p>
<p>
Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.</p>
<p>
For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of 1, so $e(2)= 2$. <br />
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be 0.33333333 for the straight case and 0.22654092 for the diagonal case, leading to $e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point each). </p>

It is possible to find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any triangular number, $T_n$, then $AT_n +B$ is always a triangular number. We define $F_3(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$. For example $F_3(100) = 184$.
</p>
<p>
Polygonal numbers are generalisations of triangular numbers. Polygonal numbers with parameter $k$ we call $k$-gonal numbers. The formula for the $n$th $k$-gonal number is $\frac 12n\big(n(k-2)+4-k\big)$ where $n \ge 1$. For example when $k = 3$ we get $\frac 12n(n+1)$ the formula for triangular numbers.
</p>
<p>
The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any $k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any pentagonal number, $P_n$, then $AP_n+B$ is always a pentagonal number. We define $F_5(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$.

652,"<p>Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length $L$ millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.</p>

<p>Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.</p>

<p>To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:<br />
$r_1 = 6\,563\,116$<br />
$r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \bmod 32\,745\,673$<br />
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for $2\le j\le N$, counting from the west, the gap between the $(j-1)$th and $j$th marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by $(r_j \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres.
Furthermore, the $j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r_j \le 10\,000\,000$, and westward if $r_j &gt; 10\,000\,000$.</p>

<p>For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' <i>centres</i> are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.</p>

For example, the triangle (217, 248, 403) is 9-pandigital because it contains one angle of 120 degrees and the sides written in base 9 are $261_9, 305_9, 487_9$ using each of the 9 digits of that base once.</p>

<p>So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin with probability $p$ of Heads (and hence probability $1-p$ of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the match.</p>

<p>Let $p_A$ denote the probability of $A$ winning a game and $p_B$ the probability of $B$ winning a game. Accordingly $1-p_A-p_B$ is the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let $\mathbb{E}_A(p_A,p_B,p)$ denote the expected number of times $A$ was leading in the match.<br />

For example, $\mathbb{E}_A(0.25,0.25,0.5)\approx 0.585786$ and $\mathbb{E}_A(0.47,0.48,0.001)\approx 377.471736$, both rounded to six places after the decimal point.</p>

665,"Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types: $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Individual bacteria are capable of multiplying and mutating between the types according to the following rules:
<ul><li>Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind of transformation.</li>
<li>Each individual $A$ of type $\alpha$ will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
<ul><li>clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type $\alpha$ (alongside $A$ who remains)</li>
<li>split into 3 new bacteria of type $\beta$ (replacing $A$)</li>

<li>die</li>
</ul></li></ul><p>
If a population starts with a single bacterium of type $\alpha$, then it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.
</p>
<p>
Now consider another species of bacteria, $S_{k,m}$ (where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers), which occurs in $k$ different types $\alpha_i$ for $0\le i&lt; k$. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence $r_n$ defined by:

<li>$r_{n+1} = r_n^2 \bmod 10\,007$</li>
</ul><p>
Every minute, for each $i$, each bacterium $A$ of type $\alpha_i$ will independently choose an integer $j$ uniformly at random in the range $0\le j&lt;m$. What it then does depends on $q = r_{im+j} \bmod 5$:</p>
<ul><li>If $q=0$, $A$ dies.</li>
<li>If $q=1$, $A$ clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type $\alpha_i$ (alongside $A$ who remains).</li>
<li>If $q=2$, $A$ mutates, changing into type $\alpha_{(2i) \bmod k}$.</li>
<li>If $q=3$, $A$ splits into 3 new bacteria of type $\alpha_{(i^2+1) \bmod k}$ (replacing $A$).</li>
<li>If $q=4$, $A$ spawns a new bacterium of type $\alpha_{(i+1) \bmod k}$ (alongside $A$ who remains).</li>
</ul><p>
In fact, our original species was none other than $S_{2,2}$, with $\alpha=\alpha_0$ and $\beta=\alpha_1$.

<p>Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving 34 knights and chairs in addition to the king's throne.

<p>We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with $n=4$, if $(2,3)$ represents the bed pairing and $(1,3)(2,4)$ the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.</p>

<p>The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:</p>
<ol><li>Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.</li>

<p>Consider the sequence 1504170715041707<var>n</var> mod 4503599627370517.</p>

<p>An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.</p>

<p>For example, the first term is 1504170715041707 which is the first Eulercoin.  The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than 1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin.  However, the third term is 8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.</p>

<p>The sum of the first 2 Eulercoins is therefore 1513083232796311.</p>

<p>We shall define a <dfn>twopal</dfn> to be a palindromic tuple having at least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.</p>

<p>If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$, then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:</p>

Consider a stack of bottles of wine. There are $n$ layers in the stack with the top layer containing only one bottle and the bottom layer containing $n$ bottles. For $n=4$ the stack looks like the picture below.

<div class=""center"">
<img src=""project/images/p726_FallingBottles.jpg"" class=""dark_img"" alt="""" /></div>
<p>
The <i>collapsing process</i> happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:
</p><ul><li>No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking $F$.</li>
<li>One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $D$.</li>
<li>Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $C$.</li>
</ul><p>
This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$. If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.

Card Stacking is a game on a computer starting with an array of $N$ cards labelled $1,2,\ldots,N$.
A stack of cards can be moved by dragging horizontally with the mouse to another stack but only when the resulting stack is in sequence. The goal of the game is to combine the cards into a single stack using minimal total drag distance.

Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains $s$ suits with each suit containing $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$.</p>

<p>
Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These are called the visible cards.</p>

<p>
The players then make moves in turn.<br />
A move consists of choosing a card X from the rest of the deck and placing it face-up on top of a visible card Y, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>X and Y must be the same suit;</li>
<li>the value of X must be larger than the value of Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The card X then covers the card Y and replaces Y as a visible card.<br />
The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.</p>

<p>
Let $C(n, s)$ be the number of different initial sets of cards for which the first player will lose given best play for both players.</p>

<p>
For example, $C(3, 2) = 26$ and $C(13, 4) \equiv 540318329 \pmod {1\,000\,000\,007}$.</p>

<p>
Find $C(10^7, 10^7)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula: $P_n = \tfrac 12n(3n-1)$ giving the sequence:
</p>
$$1,5,12,22,35, 51,70,92,\ldots $$
<p>
Some pentagonal numbers can be expressed as the sum of two other pentagonal numbers.<br />
For example:
</p>
$$P_8 = 92 = 22 + 70 = P_4 + P_7$$
<p>
3577 is the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of two pentagonal numbers in two different ways
</p>
$$
\begin{align}
P_{49} = 3577 &amp; = 3432 + 145 = P_{48} + P_{10} \\
 &amp; = 3290 + 287 = P_{47}+P_{14}

An integer of the form $p^q q^p$ with prime numbers $p \neq q$ is called a <i>hybrid-integer</i>.<br />
For example, $800 = 2^5 5^2$ is a hybrid-integer.
</p>
<p>
We define $C(n)$ to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to $n$.<br />
You are given $C(800) = 2$ and $C(800^{800}) = 10790$
